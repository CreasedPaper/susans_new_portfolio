        <p>Hi! I'm Susan Brethauer! In May of 2023 I finished my BS in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo with 
            a concentration in software. In my time at university I built many applications, mostly 
            webapps where I developed my love for front-end web development. In Spring of 2023 I 
            worked in a team of four to develop BetterReads, a new book web app for readers to document
            their latest reads, find and make reviews, and have all all around better user experience
            than goodreads. This application earned me(and my team) third place at the department demo 
            day where we were competing with long term, multi-semester and graduate student projects.
